		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<p>Pavithra U is a student who like coding.She sits behind the screen day and night and do her school work and homeworks, As per calculation she can get glasses anytime by now

			PavithraU is a normal girl in sm shetty, And I'll tell you she HATES socializing. Ahh yes She is also a very dumb kid who can misspell her sirname, That's why ahe always calls herself 'PavithraU'.

			In 2010, it was middle of July A navy little Pavithra was born. She was normal, she have normal features and normal heart beat. BUT HER ACTIONS WERE NOT! this girl I'm telling you used to put phone in a bucket of water and always sleep at 3 in the AM. But now that she is 10, she doesn't do those things (hopefully). We don't know how PavithraU got the skills of coding, none of her family member knew coding, writing coding is totally out question. She wasn't forced into coding when she was young, she was just play with some kids when she saw a flyer for coding classes and asked her mother if she could join there classes. To which her mother gladly agreed. And rest is history.</p>
